TrueCars Best Rated Vehicles for2023||Best Vehicles||Menu||We sifted through the data to select the best carsand trucks in every category.||The all-new 2023 Honda Accord has the potential to lead the midsize family sedan class with its optimal blend of value, efficiency, and capabilities. The Honda Accord is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 6 trim levels. The most popular style is the EX, which starts at $30,705 and comes with a 1.5L I4 Turbo engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Accord is estimated to deliver 29 MPG in the city and 37 MPG on the highway.||Shoppers may be flocking to SUVs as family haulers, but that doesn't mean traditional midsize family sedans have lost their relevance. Sedans might not have the elevated ride height or cargo capacity of an SUV, but they typically make up for it with a lower purchase price, better fuel economy, and improved handling. Honda's Accord has dominated this class for decades, and this year marks the arrival of a new generation.||The 2023 Honda Accord has been completely redesigned with fresh styling inside and out, new features, and the choice of a conventional gas or a hybrid powertrain. Both are competitive with rivals in power and efficiency, and Honda now offers a pre-paid maintenance plan for the first two years. Otherwise, the Accord returns with an adequately spacious interior and pleasant driving characteristics.||Of course, the Accord isn't the only sedan worth considering. The Kia K5 is a strong rival that benefits from sporty styling and a lot of features for the money. It's also offered with all-wheel drive, which should interest those who live in regions with inclement weather. The related Hyundai Sonata is front-wheel drive only but benefits from a high-performance N model and the same lengthy warranty as the Kia. The Toyota Camry is a popular choice valued for its reliability, but its age is showing, and its driving dynamics and interior are disappointing compared to other sedans.||We wouldn't be the least bit surprised if this new Accord maintains its class-leading role. We'll have more information in addition to driving impressions soon, so check back for the latest developments.||Shoppers may be flocking to SUVs as family haulers, but that doesn't mean traditional midsize family sedans have lost their relevance.

Its larger size makes it roomier inside, but harder to maneuver in congested urban environments. The Kia Sportage is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 12 trim levels. The most popular style is the X-Line AWD, which starts at $32,415 and comes with a 2.5L I4 engine and All Wheel Drive. This Sportage is estimated to deliver 23 MPG in the city and 28 MPG on the highway.||The Kia Sportage is all-new for 2023 with a striking exterior design, increased size, and new hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains. There's also a wide range of trims so it's easy to find the right one for your specific needs. The redesigned Sportage combines improved handling that makes it more engaging to drive with an attractive, larger interior. Kia isn't a luxury brand, but it continues to put thoughtfully chosen, high-quality materials into its vehicles, so they look and feel more premium than their prices suggest. Families will appreciate the extra cargo and passenger room, but the larger exterior dimensions mean it's not quite as easy to squeeze into tight parking spots. It's still a compact crossover, but it's now on the upper end of the size range. It has a good amount of standard safety tech and a fully featured infotainment system. All of this, combined with affordable pricing, makes the Kia Sportage a crossover with plenty of appeal.||The Honda CR-V has comparable pricing with a less intuitive infotainment system and no plug-in hybrid option. The Toyota RAV4 offers three engine variants along with a comprehensive infotainment system and a smooth ride. The Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is offered only with a gas engine and is more affordable, but not as well-appointed.||The Kia Sportage is all-new for 2023 with a striking exterior design, increased size, and new hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains.

But the five-seat hatchback does have a few weaknesses, including reduced cargo space and a cramped rear seating area that may turn away some hybrid shoppers. The Toyota Prius is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the LE FWD, which starts at $28,545 and comes with a Hybrid 2.0L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Prius is estimated to deliver 57 MPG in the city and 56 MPG on the highway.||A complete makeover for 2023 turned Toyotas ugly duckling hybrid into a true beauty. The five-seat compact hatchback lost headroom and cargo space in its transformation but gained improved handling, a more comfortable ride, an updated interior, and a 60% boost in power while retaining its best-in-class fuel efficiency. The base model actually gained 1 mpg over the old L Eco trim.||Crossovers and SUVs are rapidly replacing sedans and sedan-like hatchbacks such as the Prius in car shoppers affections, but the Prius still has a few direct competitors, and in most comparisons, the Prius wins.||The Kia Niro hybrid, the competitive sets only crossover, is slightly pricier but has a tad more cargo space than the upper 2023 Prius trims; the Hyundai Elantra hybrid is about the same size, costs less, and comes close to matching the Prius lineup in fuel efficiency; and Toyotas own Corolla hybrid costs less and is about the same size.||Despite its lowered head room, the Prius has a surprisingly airy front cockpit area with the most front legroom among its rivals. It ties with the Corolla hybrid, however, for least rear legroom and stands alone with the least rear headroom. Even so, the 2023 Prius has more power and better overall fuel efficiency than any of its competitors and, hands down, looks a whole lot nicer.||A complete makeover for 2023 turned Toyotas ugly duckling hybrid into a true beauty.

It will appeal to those who appreciate creature comforts and the easy access and improved visibility of taller seating but prefer the look and feel of a sedan to a boxy crossover. The Toyota Crown is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the Limited, which starts at $46,645 and comes with a Hybrid 2.5L I4 engine and All Wheel Drive. This Crown is estimated to deliver 42 MPG in the city and 41 MPG on the highway.||It has been 50 years since Toyota last sold its Crown sedan in the U.S., but the model was introduced in Japan in 1955 as the Toyopet Crown. It has been Toyota's mainstream sedan there ever since, the choice of families, executives, taxi drivers, and police.||The 2023 Crown, now in its 16th generation, is back in the States as the three-trim, all-hybrid, all-wheel-drive, tall-roofed, fastback-styled four-door replacing the venerable Toyota Avalon sedan. It is almost the same size, inside and out, as the Honda Accord and Volkswagen Arteon sedans.||The Crown's tall roofline and high seating position have generated some debate. But there's no denying that it is eye-catching, especially in the optional two-tone color scheme available with the top Platinum trim.||By positioning the Crown as a premium model, Toyota is telling shoppers that this is a special vehicle, not to be confused with other midsize sedans. By offering two hybrid powertrains, one of them more performance-oriented, Toyota hopes the Crown will appeal to those seeking fuel efficiency and creature comforts as well as those hoping for a bit of twisty country road fun.||We found that generally, it succeeds but still falls short on driving excitement, even with the 340-horsepower hybrid system and adaptive suspension that come exclusively with the Platinum trim.||Competition in the non-luxury large sedan segment is almost gone. Three rivals  the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, and Nissan Maxima  are being discontinued in 2023. That leaves the Accord Hybrid and VW Arteon. Some shoppers might consider the Genesis G80, Audi A6, and Volvo S90 mild hybrids, all of which cost more and aren't likely to be cross-shopped with the Toyota Crown. Based on appearance and premium content, though, the Crown can proudly hold its head high in that crowd.||It has been 50 years since Toyota last sold its Crown sedan in the U.S., but the model was introduced in Japan in 1955 as the Toyopet Crown.

Add in its excellent value, fuel-efficient hybrid models, and sharp styling, and it's tough to beat. The Kia Sorento is a 6-seater vehicle that comes in 11 trim levels. The most popular style is the Hybrid EX AWD, which starts at $40,315 and comes with a Hybrid 1.6L I4 Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive. This Sorento is estimated to deliver 36 MPG in the city and 33 MPG on the highway.||One of the best pieces of advice for those buying a car is to pick the smallest vehicle that meets your needs. In return, you'll benefit from a lower purchase price as well as improved maneuverability and fuel efficiency. If you need three rows of seats, you typically have to choose a midsize or large SUV or a minivan. The 2023 Kia Sorento, however, is one of the few small SUVs that is available with three rows.||Compared to the larger and praiseworthy Kia Telluride, the Sorento costs several thousand dollars less, returns better fuel economy (especially with the hybrid variants), and is easier to park. The Sorento isn't the only small three-row SUV. The Mitsubishi Outlander and Volkswagen Tiguan offer similar versatility but fall short of the Kia in overall value and warranty coverage.||The third row in these small SUVs might be tight, but for occasional use by smaller passengers, they prove adequate. If you can get by with less space, we highly recommend starting your search with the 2023 Kia Sorento.

A tight third row and few options leave it vulnerable to the competition, but it's light years ahead of its predecessor in terms of performance, comfort, and technology. The Toyota Sequoia is a 7-seater vehicle that comes in 5 trim levels. The most popular style is the Platinum 4WD, which starts at $77,060 and comes with a Hybrid 3.4L V6 Twin-Turbo engine and Four Wheel Drive. This Sequoia is estimated to deliver 19 MPG in the city and 22 MPG on the highway.||After languishing for years without a redesign, the Toyota Sequoia is all-new this year. The interior is more spacious and refined, while the exterior makes a bold first impression. The standard V8 is gone, but in its place is a new twin-turbocharged hybrid V6 with more power and torque. Not only can the Sequoia tow up to 9,520 pounds, it does so while delivering better fuel economy than the previous model. The spacious interior offers plenty of room for people and their cargo, although Toyota stuck with a solid rear axle design that limits passenger space in the third row. The technology inside received a major update as well, with an optional 14-inch touchscreen and full compatibility with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. A long list of standard and available safety features rounds out the package. It's been more than a decade since the previous generation of the Sequoia was introduced, making this new third-generation significantly better from its powertrain and handling to its features and technologies.||The competing Chevrolet Tahoe is priced lower but has no hybrid engine. The Ford Expedition also has a lower starting price.

Tech updates should help close the gap with more advanced rivals, while retaining classic CR-V traits: roomy cabin, ample cargo space, gentle ride, and impressive fuel efficiency. The Honda CR-V is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 5 trim levels. The most popular style is the Hybrid Sport Touring AWD, which starts at $40,395 and comes with a Hybrid 2.0L I4 engine and All Wheel Drive. This CR-V is estimated to deliver 40 MPG in the city and 34 MPG on the highway.||The 2023 Honda CR-V ushers in the next generation of Hondas compact SUV, with comprehensive updates that should keep it near the top of its class. A top-seller since its debut nearly 30 years ago, the CR-V doesnt lend itself to wholesale reinvention every few years. If anything, Honda has been happy to make tweaks here and there to keep the CR-V competitive. But with no shortage of rivals in this popular segment, the CR-V had fallen behind  not in comfort or competence, it remains one of the most refined choices in the class  but in infotainment tech and active safety features.||The incoming CR-V looks to turn that all around, starting with a fully revamped chassis  longer and slightly wider  that opens up a bit more interior room and possibly even improves handling (we wont know until weve driven one). The new model looks brawnier and more adventure-ready, inspired by the Honda Ridgeline pickup and larger Honda Passport SUV, and the tech gets a significant upgrade with larger touchscreens, more advanced software, and features like wireless smartphone control. Hybrid models also get a power bump that now allows for towing loads of up to 1,000 pounds. That's not exactly diesel pickup capability, but it's noteworthy for a hybrid-powered CR-V.||The updates should place the CR-V back near the top of its class, with fuel economy comparable to the Toyota RAV4  and tech and infotainment to match the Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sorento. It may not keep up with the athletic moves of the Mazda CX-5 or venture as deep off-highway as the Subaru Forester, but the new-generation Honda CR-V will certainly check plenty of boxes for many buyers.||The 2023 Honda CR-V ushers in the next generation of Hondas compact SUV, with comprehensive updates that should keep it near the top of its class.

But with no hybrid option, it's less fuel-efficient than its strongest rivals. The Kia Carnival is a 7-seater vehicle that comes in 5 trim levels. The most popular style is the EX, which starts at $39,965 and comes with a 3.5L V6 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Carnival is estimated to deliver 19 MPG in the city and 26 MPG on the highway.||Some people value a minivan's utility but would never buy one because they're repelled by its sheet metal. If you're one of those people, the 2023 Kia Carnival has your number. It's a minivan through and through, with the three-row seating and power-sliding doors that make this vehicle type a family-friendly favorite. But its exterior design  which features a flatter nose and more upright styling than minivans like the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna  makes it look more like a large SUV. The Carnival provides a full suite of family-focused amenities. For example, it offers a camera system that lets you keep an eye on children in the rearmost seats. And to top things off, this minivan has a lower base price than competing models.||Unlike the Sienna, the Carnival doesn't provide all-wheel drive. And Kia doesn't offer a hybrid variant; this minivan is less fuel-efficient than rivals with hybrid powertrains, such as the Sienna and Chrysler Pacifica hybrid. But overall, the Carnival succeeds at putting a fresh spin on a familiar workhorse. It's a godsend if you're looking for a family hauler that's stylish and practical.||Some people value a minivan's utility but would never buy one because they're repelled by its sheet metal.

The Lexus RX is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 10 trim levels. The most popular style is the RX 350 Premium Plus FWD, which starts at $53,150 and comes with a 2.4L I4 Turbo engine and Front Wheel Drive. This RX is estimated to deliver 22 MPG in the city and 29 MPG on the highway.||Lexus 2023 RX lineup gets its first complete redo since 2016, including an evolutionary exterior refresh and a complete rethinking of the interior. The redesign also makes room for the first-ever plug-in hybrid version, the RX 450h+, which we will review closer to its debut later in the model year.||These welcome changes should help keep the RX firmly ensconced atop the heap in the ever-growing, super-competitive midsize premium crossover segment, where it faces off with worthy rivals including the Acura MDX, Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Audi Q7, BMW X5, Genesis GV80, Lincoln Nautilus, Mercedes-Benz GLE, and Volvo XC90.||What the top-selling RX has going for it is that it leaves the niches to the other guys and offers shoppers a quiet, comfortable, well-equipped cabin, decent handling and power, a luxury-car ride, contemporary good looks, and the promise of Lexus quality and reliability.||The RX family also offers plenty of choice. There are multiple trims in each variety, whether gas-only, standard hybrid, or (soon) plug-in hybrid; rear- or all-wheel drive; and regular or sporty. In all, there are 10 gas-only and gas-electric hybrid trim levels (14, counting AWD options), even before the plug-in hybrid version is introduced. No competitor can match that breadth and depth, although BMW and Volvo do offer plug-in hybrid versions of their midsize crossovers.||Lexus dropped the RX-L with three-row seating for 2023, but its not a big loss as there wasnt much room in the third row. Shoppers who really need seating for seven will have to look at the MDX, Q7, GV80, GLE, or XC90. Lexus will be introducing a longer TX crossover with a third row.||Also stripped from the 2023 RX lineup are the thirsty V6 engine and the much-criticized touchpad controller. Gas-only variants now have a turbocharged inline-four that gets 2 mpg more in combined city and highway driving. The touchpad controller was replaced by a new infotainment operating system thats easier to navigate by touch or voice.||The 2023 RX is the same length as its predecessor, but the wheelbase has been stretched 2.4 inches, expanding cargo area and rear legroom. It is also an inch wider and, giving it a racier appearance, its roofline is almost 3 inches lower and the rear overhang is much shorter. Adding to its improved looks is the revised grille, which has lost its top third and now just looks really big instead of gargantuan.||The RX has never been the fastest, roomiest, or most technologically advanced midsize premium crossover, but it is the segments most broadly appealing model. It should stay that way for 2023.||Lexus 2023 RX lineup gets its first complete redo since 2016, including an evolutionary exterior refresh and a complete rethinking of the interior.

This full-size pickup continues to be a compelling option, but it doesn't have the range of configurations or engine options offered by competitors. The Toyota Tundra is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 10 trim levels.

This Tundra is estimated to deliver 17 MPG in the city and 23 MPG on the highway.||The Toyota Tundra was all-new last year with a slew of upgrades. The most notable changes were the addition of a hybrid engine, upgraded infotainment, and a revised suspension system that delivers a greatly improved ride. The Tundra's interior also received upgrades to match the levels offered by competitors. A new range-topping Capstone trim provides a truly refined experience for those who want a touch of luxury in their capable truck. The lineup now includes seven trims, Double or CrewMax cabs, three bed lengths, and a choice of rear- or four-wheel drive.||Although the Tundra's various configurations can manage everything from work to family fun, competitors also provide a wide range of possibilities. The Ram 1500 has the most refined ride in the segment, with more trims and engine options. The Ford F-150 has the highest towing and payload ratings available. The Chevrolet Silverado 1500 has more engines and trims but a less attractive interior.||The Toyota Tundra was all-new last year with a slew of upgrades.

It should have the credentials to take on the best three-row SUVs when it goes on sale at the end of 2022. The Honda Pilot is a 8-seater vehicle that comes in 5 trim levels. The most popular style is the Elite AWD, which starts at $53,725 and comes with a 3.5L V6 engine and All Wheel Drive. This Pilot is estimated to deliver 19 MPG in the city and 25 MPG on the highway.||Three-row midsize SUVs are excellent choices for growing families, and the Honda Pilot was the go-to choice until the Kia Telluride arrived in 2020. The redesigned 2023 Honda Pilot looks to recapture the top spot with a host of changes and upgrades. The new Pilot is 3.4 inches longer than its predecessor, resulting in more legroom for second and third-row passengers. It also increases cargo capacity to class-leading dimensions.||On the outside, the new Pilot has a more upright, utilitarian shape, giving it a strong presence that suits the updated TrailSport off-road model. The previous TrailSport was more of an appearance package, but the new model has legitimate off-road capabilities. Inside, a new removable second-row center seat provides unparalleled versatility, too.||Given the numerous enhancements and improvements, the 2023 Honda Pilot has the right stuff to better challenge the Telluride and related Hyundai Palisade.||Three-row midsize SUVs are excellent choices for growing families, and the Honda Pilot was the go-to choice until the Kia Telluride arrived in 2020.

The Kia Telluride is a 7-seater vehicle that comes in 10 trim levels. The most popular style is the S AWD, which starts at $41,155 and comes with a 3.8L V6 engine and All Wheel Drive. This Telluride is estimated to deliver 18 MPG in the city and 24 MPG on the highway.||If you're in the market for a three-row midsize SUV, you'd do well to check out the 2023 Kia Telluride.

The interior is new and its modern execution includes a curved glass display. The cabin continues to draw praise for its sturdy construction and materials that rival some luxury vehicles. There are also two new trim levels available with added off-road capabilities: the X-Line and X-Pro.||The Kia Telluride is the standard by which other SUVs in the class are judged.

The Hyundai Palisade is one of the best in this class and this year's changes and additions should make it even more attractive.

It's also similarly easy to drive and gets you a lot of features for the money, while distinguishing itself with a more luxurious style and personality.||The Palisade's softer suspension tuning trades some handling confidence for comfort when compared to the Telluride, but not to the extent that it could be a deciding factor between the two. If you're one of the rare shoppers seeking more driver engagement, the Mazda CX-9 or Volkswagen Atlas may be more to your liking. Compared to other SUVs in the class, the Palisade isn't quite as fuel efficient as the Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander (especially the hybrid Highlander), but when the final scores are tallied, the Hyundai Palisade still comes out on top overall.||If you have a growing family but aren't ready to take the minivan route, fear not, there are plenty of three-row SUVs that are capable alternatives.
